# SOLDERING_24V
Do-it-yourself soldering iron assembly, under the control of Arduino, on 900M tips.

If you can make yourself an instrument, it's better to make it!
Anyone who is fond of electronics one way or another is forced to use such a tool as a soldering iron. 
Therefore, many have a desire to make a soldering iron "for themselves", especially since the microcontroller on the Arduino allows you to implement many useful functions without serious expenditures in time and money. 
Many similar projects have been implemented before me and even more will come after. 
The main thing is that you yourself like the result. 

Watch a short video about the functionality and internal "stuffing" of the soldering iron on my YouTube channel!

Unfortunately, all comments are in Russian only ...

All third-party libraries I found and connected to Arduino IDE. There are two libraries on GitHub, if you cannot find it yourself, you can pick it up from the OUTSIDE_LIBRARIES folder.
