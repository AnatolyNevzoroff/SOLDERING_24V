# SOLDERING_24V
Do-it-yourself soldering iron assembly, under the control of Arduino, on 900M tips.
If you can make yourself an instrument, it's better to make it!
Anyone who is fond of electronics one way or another is forced to use such a tool as a soldering iron. 
Therefore, many have a desire to make a soldering iron "for themselves", especially since the microcontroller on the Arduino allows you to implement many useful functions without serious expenditures in time and money. 
Many similar projects have been implemented before me and even more will come after. 
The main thing is that you yourself like the result. 
It seems that I got exactly what I wanted, although I was not very lucky in terms of time, since waiting for the instrument microcircuits to amplify the signal from the Wotstone measuring bridge took several times longer than the assembly and setup itself. I hope you will be interested in this topic and you will get your own or similar to this tool for creating something even more interesting.
